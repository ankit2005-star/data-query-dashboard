# Data Query Dashboard ðŸ“Š

Hey there! Iâ€™m so excited to share my **Gen AI Analytics Dashboard** with you! I built this project for the **Internshala Frontend Engineering Intern Challenge**, and Iâ€™ve poured my heart into making it something youâ€™ll love. This dashboard lets you ask business questions in simple English, keeps track of your past queries, and shows the results in a neat bar chart. Itâ€™s user-friendly, looks great on any device, and has some fun animations to make the experience even better. Letâ€™s dive in! ðŸ˜Š

## What This Dashboard Does
This project is all about making data analytics easy and fun! Hereâ€™s what you can do with it:
- **Ask Questions in Plain English**: Just type questions like "Whatâ€™s the sales trend this quarter?" or "Show revenue by region" â€“ as if youâ€™re chatting with a friend.
- **Keep Track of Your Queries**: It saves all your past questions in a history section, so you can look back anytime (and clear them if you want).
- **See Results in a Bar Chart**: The app shows your query results in a clean and colorful bar chart thatâ€™s easy to understand.
- **Fun Animations**: Iâ€™ve added some smooth animations to make everything feel lively â€“ like when the chart loads or when you clear your history.
- **Works on Any Device**: Whether youâ€™re on your phone or laptop, the dashboard looks awesome and works perfectly.
- **Friendly Error Messages**: If something goes wrong, youâ€™ll get a simple message to help you out â€“ no confusing tech stuff!

## Tools I Used to Build This
Hereâ€™s the tech stack I used to bring this project to life:
- **React.js**: For building the UI and managing all the components.
- **Vite**: To make development super fast and smooth (I love how quick it is!).
- **Redux Toolkit**: To manage the appâ€™s state, like storing queries and results.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the app with a clean and modern design.
- **Framer Motion**: To add those cool animations that make the app feel alive.
- **Chart.js & react-chartjs-2**: For creating the bar chart to show query results.
- **React Icons**: For adding icons to make the UI more intuitive.

## How to Try It Out
Want to see the dashboard in action on your own machine? Itâ€™s really easy to set up! Just follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ankit2005-star/data-query-dashboard.git
   cd data-query-dashboard

2.**Install Dependencies**:
   npm install

3.**Start the Development Server:**:
   npm run dev
Open in Browser: Go to http://localhost:5173 to check out the app!
 
My Journey of Building This Project
Let me tell you a bit about how I made this dashboard:

Getting Started: I chose Vite to set up the project because itâ€™s super fast and works great with React. It made my life so much easier!
Managing Data: I used Redux Toolkit to handle the appâ€™s state â€“ like keeping track of user queries, history, and results. I also used createAsyncThunk to simulate AI responses for the queries.
Designing the Look: I went with Tailwind CSS to style the app. It helped me create a clean and responsive design without spending too much time on custom CSS.
Adding the Chart: I used Chart.js with react-chartjs-2 to show query results in a bar chart. I made sure the chart is colorful and animates nicely when it loads.
Making It Smooth: I added animations using Framer Motion â€“ like a spinning loader, fading cards, and smooth transitions when you interact with the app.
Testing on Different Devices: I tested the app on my phone and laptop to make sure it looks great and works well everywhere.
Challenges I Ran Into
Building this project wasnâ€™t always easy â€“ here are some bumps I hit along the way and how I got past them:

Setting Up Tailwind CSS: I had some trouble with Tailwind CSS v4 at first, but I figured it out by installing @tailwindcss/postcss and setting up tailwind.config.js.
Getting the Chart to Work: The bar chart wasnâ€™t showing up properly at first. I realized I needed to register all Chart.js components (CategoryScale, LinearScale, etc.), and that fixed it!
Handling Async Data: Managing asynchronous query processing was a bit tricky, but I used Redux Toolkitâ€™s createAsyncThunk to simulate AI responses, and it worked out well.
Line Endings on Windows: I got some warnings about CRLF/LF line endings since Iâ€™m on Windows. I added a .gitattributes file to make sure line endings are consistent across platforms.
Why I Think This Project Is Special
I really tried to make this project stand out, and hereâ€™s why I think itâ€™s worth checking out:

Easy to Use: I designed the app to be super simple â€“ anyone can use it without getting confused.
Smooth and Fun: The animations make the app feel polished and enjoyable to use.
Looks Great Everywhere: I made sure the app works perfectly on both mobile and desktop screens.
Little Details Matter: I added things like a loading spinner, error messages, and hover effects to make the app feel complete.
Clean Code: I kept the code organized and used Redux Toolkit for state management, so itâ€™s easy to understand and maintain.
Ideas for the Future
If I get a chance to work on this project more, here are some things Iâ€™d love to add:

More chart types (like line or pie charts) to show data in different ways.
A real AI API to process natural language queries for even better results.
User login so people can save their query history.
Maybe some fun customization options for the UI!
A Bit About Me
Hi, Iâ€™m ANKIT GODBOLE ! Iâ€™m a frontend developer who loves creating web apps that are both useful and beautiful. Working on this project was such a fun experience, and I learned so much about React, state management, and UI design. Iâ€™m really excited about the chance to join Internshala as a Frontend Engineering Intern and work on awesome projects! ðŸ˜„

Thanks for taking the time to check out my project! I hope you like it as much as I loved building it. ðŸš€
